#Introduction

Two dimensional linear transport problem in order to assess the performance of the nodal DG method on triangular elements and on quadrilateral elements.

#Problem description

The governing equation

where *u* is the scalar variable, the flux term is

$$\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{a}(x) = (a_1(x)u, a_2(x)u).$$

1. computation domain
$[-L, L]$, where $L = 1$.

2. advection velocity
$[a_1, a_2] = (-wy, wx)$, where $w = 5\pi/6$. The advection period is $T = \frac{2\pi}{w} = 2.4$ s.

#Conclusion

1. For square meshes, the numerical scheme can preserve stability without slope limiter and achieve the optimial order of accuracy (for p < 6).
2. The error of square meshes decrease as DOFs increases. With the same number of DOFs, higher order scheme produce less numerical errors.
3. Square methes produce less error than triangle meshes with the same number of DOFs

In all, the numerical schemes on square meshes has a better performance than on triangle meshes with much less non-physical instability or numerical error.
